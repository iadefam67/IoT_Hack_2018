## The Project
40 years ago, chemical pollution filled the air causing acid rain which fell into rivers and streams and made its way into our bodies.  40 years ago, the Mood Ring was the rage.  We have come a long way in our pursuit of a healthy planet and ensuring a sustainable future but air pollution continues to impact how we live and breathe. Natural emergencies such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions radically change the air quality.  Air pollution contributes to diseases such respiratory lung diseases, leukemia, birth defects, cardiovascular problems, neurobehavioral disorders, liver and other types of cancer, and premature death. The CDC sites people with asthma or other lung diseases, older adults, people of all ages who exercise or work hard outside, and babies and children as those who are most at risk.

### How can we protect ourselves and our families from the negative effects of air pollution? 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determines the Air Quality Index (AQI) in a region. However, this is a general index and not specific to your personal air space. We need to enhance our awareness of the air pollution in our personal space using a modern version of the Mood Ring, the Air Quality (AQ) Smart Ring.  The AQ Smart Ring is a wearable device which comes in three forms, an actual ring, a wrist band and an amulet. The device reads the air quality around you and shows a corresponding air quality color code that makes it easy to quickly understand your personal air quality.

The negative impacts of air quality may take days or weeks before you see signs of health problems. With the AQ Smart Ring, you are immediately aware of poor air quality and take action to improve your surroundings. Your air quality is also tracked and can be reviewed against the air quality in your region to help you determine what actions you need to take to improve your personal surroundings. 

## The Result
We built a proof-of-concept prototype that includes:
* A working microcontroller, sensor and LED indicator
  * Adafruit MiCS-5524 Gas Sensor Breakout
  * Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266
* A web interface to display status information and aggregate results
* A web server to host and serve web results
